JQuery integration for ConboJS
==============================

ConboJS 4 and above no longer require jQuery, but if you would still like to use the jQuery features that were integrated into previous versions, then this is the library for you.

The `conbo-jquery.js` library can be used as an AMD module, CommonJS or as a global, and once loaded will automatically add the following properties and methods to ConboJS:

* `conbo.$`
* `View.$(selector, deep)`
* `View.$el`
* `View.$body`
* `View.$content`
